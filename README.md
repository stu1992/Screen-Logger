# Screen-Logger
script to capture a time lapse of linux desktop screen and mouse movements

Some notes on this script
 * mouse position polling has only worked with wired usb mice from my experience. Compatibility with other devices hasn't been implemented
 * Screen resolution has been hard coded at 1366X768
